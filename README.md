Example unit testing code to demonstrate hamcrest and mockito with JUnit

For use with Unit testing slides here:
http://www.slideshare.net/DavidGunthorpe/unit-testing-50762851

## Note

The tests mostly fail in order to highlight the assertion failure messages produced by JUnit and the more readable ones from Hamcrest.
